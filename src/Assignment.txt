
SCOPE
	implementing the parser function which parses the headers and image data of .png(Portable Network Graphics) files.

Requirements:

	1)   .png file
	
	2)   Function to extract the contents of only the header of the .png file on entering -h as one of the arguments.

	3)   Function should extract the contents of only the image data of the .png file (and not the header of the file) in hexadecimal ie. 		     to show the hexdump of the .png file on entering -d as one the arguments.

	4)  The functionality should display the contents of header as well as the image data of the .png file when the user doesn't enter any 		    of the above arguments.

	Values 		Purpose
	89 		Has the high bit set to detect transmission systems that do not support 8 bit data and to reduce the chance that a text 			file is	mistakenly interpreted as a PNG, or vice versa.

	50 4E 47 	In ASCII, the letters PNG, allowing a person to identify the format easily if it is viewed in a text editor.

	0D 0A 		A DOS-style line ending (CRLF) to detect DOS-Unix line ending conversion of the data.

	1A 		A byte that stops display of the file under DOS when the command type has been usedâ€”the end-of-file character

	0A 		A Unix-style line ending (LF) to detect Unix-DOS line ending conversion.
